Welcome  to the New Cytoscape Build Process
--------------------------------------------

I.  Doing a Clean Checkout
==========================

If this is the first time reading this, make sure that you have done a clean checkout.  To
do this, create a backup of your local installation of cytoscape.  Then, set your CVSROOT environment
variable to point to:  /common/cvsdir4.

Then, do a clean check-out:

cvs checkout -P cytoscape

II.  New Directory Structure
============================

Cytoscape now contains the following directory structure:

cytoscape
   +
   +---bin/       Contains all OS specific scripts, e.g. shell scripts and batch files.
   +
   +---build/     This directoy is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain all generated class files.
   +
   +---config/    Contains all configuration files, e.g. cytoscape.props.
   +
   +---cytodocs/  Contains all technical documentation.
   +
   +---dist/      This directory is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain cytoscape.jar.
   +
   +---images/    Contains image files
   +
   +---legacy/    Contains legacy files which will no longer be supported.
   +
   +---lib/       Contains all JAR files.
   +
   +---src/       Contains all source .java files.
   +
   +---testData/  Contains all test data
   +
   +---tools/     Contains misc. tools for cytoscape distribution.
   +
   +---user_docs/ Contains all user documentation and manuals.
