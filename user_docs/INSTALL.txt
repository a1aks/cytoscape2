INSTALLATION AND STARTUP #############################################
######################################################################

Currently, Cytoscape runs under Java on either Linux or Windows
platforms (Active Subsystems calculation available for Linux only).
The software has NOT been tested for any of the Macintosh operating
systems.  Also, although Cytoscape handles arbitrary types and sizes
of interaction network, it is most powerful when used in conjunction
with large interaction data sets such as are currently available for
species such as the yeast S. cerevisiae.

(1) Download and unpack the distribution.  Cytoscape is distributed as
a compressed archive containing the following files and directories:

INSTALL.txt ............ Quick-start installation instructions (this file)
MANUAL.txt ............. Overview and details of Cytoscape functionality
LICENSE.txt ............ The license agreement

cytoscape.jar .......... Main Cytoscape application (Java archive)
cytoscape.props ........ User-configurable properties and preferences

cytoscape.sh ........... Shell script used to run Cytoscape (Linux)
cytoscape.bat .......... Shell script used to run Cytoscape (Windows)

libActivePathsNew.so ... C++ library plug-in to search for and identify
                         "active pathways/subsystems", i.e. network
                         regions that overlap significantly with
                         changes in gene expression (Linux only)
sampleData/
   galFiltered.gml ..... Sample molecular interaction network file *
   galFiltered.sif ..... Identical network in Simple Interaction Format *
   galExpData.pvals .... Sample gene expression matrix file *
   BINDyeast.sif ....... Network of all yeast protein-protein
                         interactions in the BIND database as of 
                         February, 2002 **

GO/ .................... Directory containing Gene Ontology database
                         entries (currently for yeast only). Info
                         in this directory is used to associate 
                         gene names with synonyms as well as process, 
                         function, and and cellular location data.

*  Sample data sets taken from Ideker et al, Science 292:929 (2001)
** Obtained from data hosted at http://www.bind.ca/

(2) If not already installed on your computer, download and install
the Java 2 Runtime Environment, version 1.4 or higher.  It can be
found at:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html.

(3) Launch the application by running "cytoscape.sh" from the command
line (Linux) or double-clicking "cytoscape.bat" (Windows).
Alternatively, you can pass the .jar file to Java directly using the
command "java -jar cytoscape".  In Windows, it is also possible to
directly double-click the .jar file to launch it.  However, this does
not allow specification of command-line arguments (such as the
location of the GO data directory, see MANUAL.txt for details).

!!!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!  For the application to work properly, ALL
FILES MUST BE LEFT IN THE DIRECTORY IN WHICH THEY ARE UNPACKED.  [The
core Cytoscape application assumes this directory structure when
looking for certain files, such as cytoscape.props,
libActivePathsNew.so, and the GO/ database].
