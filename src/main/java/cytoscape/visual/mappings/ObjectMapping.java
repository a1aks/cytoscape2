 * {@link cytoscape.visual.calculators.AbstractCalculator} that owns
 * the mapping.
 * <p>
 * All classes implementing this interface <b>MUST</b> have a constructor that
 * takes the arguments Object, CyNetwork, byte, where Object is the default object
 * the mapper should map to, CyNetwork is the CyNetwork object representing the network
 * displayed in Cytoscape, and the byte is one of {@link #EDGE_MAPPING} or
 * {@link #NODE_MAPPING}.
 * 
 * K - Key attribute value.  Can be any type (for this implementation, number, string, boolean, list, or map).
 * V - Mapped visual value, such as color, node shape, etc.
