/**
 * This class is a utility for providing a popup dialog which displays progress
 * on a lengthy process.  Historically, Cytoscape tasks such as loading a
 * graph from a file or laying out a large graph were done in the AWT event
 * handling thread.  Such tasks take on the order of minutes sometimes; because
 * these tasks were computed by the AWT event handling thread, the Cytoscape
 * desktop would become unresponsive while these tasks were executing.
 * <code>ProgressUI</code> was designed as a framework to ease the transition
 * of computing lengthy tasks in theads other than the AWT event handling
 * thread; see next paragraph.<p>
 * Tasks which were initially forked as new threads to prevent the
 * unresponsive Cytoscape desktop problem touched parts of code which
 * invoked Swing and/or Piccolo libraries.  Therefore, it was necessary to
 * limit, as much as programatically possible, actions on the desktop which
 * would cause concurrent execution of similar code (Swing and Piccolo are
 * only single-thread safe).  To do this, modal dialogs were created which
 * could not be closed by the user, and which would block all user input
 * until the task in question had finished.

  /**
   * Creates a modal progress dialog.  (But does not show it, yet.)
   * A progress dialog is global and
   * there should only be one background process running at a time which
   * corresponds to this dialog - the reasoning behind this is that
   * we want to stay as close as possible to a single-threaded model.<p>
   * A plain vanilla progress dialog has no stop button and has a generic
   * progress animation which knows nothing about percent completed of the
   * process.  The two options for a progress dialog are a stop button (which
   * can be made to appear by passing a non-<code>nulL</code>
   * <code>stop</code> parameter to this method) and a progress animation with
   * a percent completed (the percent completed animation is triggered by
   * using the returned <code>ProgressUIControl</code> object).<p>
   * This method <i>MUST</i> be called from the AWT queue handling thread.<p>
   * A progress UI can only be created once all previous progress UIs have been
   * disposed of.  This method will throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code>
   * if previous progress UI has not been disposed of at the time this method
   * is called.<p>
   * A few notes on the <code>stop</code> parameter passed to this method.
   * If you're using a <code>Stoppable</code>, a &quot;Stop&quot; button will
   * appear on the modal dialog.  pushing this button will trigger, in the
   * AWT event dispatch thread, <code>stop.stop()</code> to be called.
   * Therefore, if <code>stop()</code> blocks for a while, the UI will become
   * unresponsive during this time.  Programmers should be aware of ths and
   * should prevent passing <code>Stoppable</code> objects which block for
   * long periods.
   *
   * @param parent the parent frame that will show this modal dialog; in most
   *   cases this will be <code>Cytoscape.getDesktop()</code>; this class uses
   *   an input parameter instead of using <code>cytoscape.Cytoscape</code>
   *   to avoid dependencies - this keeps code more modular.
   * @param title desired title of the dialog window; may not be
   *   <code>null</code>.
   * @param message brief message that will appear to the user;
   *   may not be <code>null</code>.
   * @param stop hook to allow a stop button to stop a process; if
   *   <code>null</code>, no stop button will appear in the dialog.
   * @return hook for controlling this UI.
   * @exception IllegalStateException if this is called while another
   *   progress dialog is currently open.
   * @exception IllegalThreadStateException if this is called from a thread
   *   that is not the AWT event handling thread
   *   (<nobr><code>java.awt.EventQueue.isDispatchThread()</code></nobr>).
