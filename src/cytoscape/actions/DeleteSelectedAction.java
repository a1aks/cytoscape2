 * Giny version of the original class. Note that the original version was
 * only available when editing mode was enabled, and caused the selected
 * nodes to be permanently removed from the graph (and, necessarily, the view).
 * This version hides the selected nodes from both the graph and the view,
 * as there are currently no methods to remove a node view from the graph view
 * in Giny. The semantics of this and related classes for modifying the
 * graph and view should be clarified.
