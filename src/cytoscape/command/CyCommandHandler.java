/**
 * The CyCommandHandler interface allows a Cytoscape plugin to make it's functions
 * available to other plugins in a loosely-coupled manner (by passing command
 * strings and arguments).  It is intended as a stop-gap measure until the ability
 * to directly call methods in other plugins (through OSGI services) is available
 * in Cytoscape 3.0.
 * <p>
 * CyCommandHandler provide a simple method for a plugin to expose some functionality
 * that can be used by other plugins.  The idea is simple: a plugin registers
 * one or more CyCommandHandlers with the {@link CyCommandManager}.  In the simplest
 * case, the plugin will directly implement CyCommandHandler:
 * <pre><code>
 * public class MyPlugin extend CytoscapePlugin implements CyCommandHandler {
 *   public MyPlugin() {
 *      // Plugin initialization
 *      try {
 *        // You must reserve your namespace first
 *        CyCommandNamespace ns = CyCommandManager.reserveNamespace("my namespace");
 *
 *        // Now register this handler as handling "command"
 *        CyCommandManager.register(ns, command, this);
 *      } catch (RuntimeException e) {
 *        // Handle already registered exceptions
 *      }
 *   }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * Alternatively, a plugin could implement multiple CyCommandHandlers, each one
 * handling a single command string.  This has the advantage of providing a clear
 * separation where each class handles a single command, and is the recommended way
 * to structure new plugins.
 * <h3>Commands</h3>
 * Each command handler can provide any number of commands.
 * A command provides the actual functionality, and the passed arguments 
 * (name, value pairs) are specific to commands.  Note that there aren't any
 * restrictions about the number of words in a command handler name or command name.  So, for
 * example, the <i>view layout</i> command handler could provide a <i>get current</i> command.
 * <h3>Arguments</h3>
 * Arguments for commands may be specified either as name, value pairs
 * (using a string, string map) or as a list of {@link Tunable}.  It is recommended
 * that whenever possible, plugins use Tunables as they provide type information
 * that is useful to allow client plugins to perform some limited validation.  In
 * either case, both signatures (maps and Tunables) should be supported.
 * <h3>Return Values</h3>
 * CyCommandHandlers pass information about the execution of a command in a {@link CyCommandResult}.  It is
 * expected that a command will provide some limited information in the CyCommandResult
 * message and the actual information in the results map.
 * <h3>Exceptions</h3>
 * A CyCommandHandler should always return a valid CyCommandResult to provide feedback to the user
 * about the execution.  If a processing error occurs, the CyCommandHandler should throw a
 * CyCommandException with an appropriate message.
 * <h3>Client Usage</h3>
 * Using a CyCommandHandler from another plugin is relatively straightforward: get the CyCommandHandler,
 * get the arguments for the desired command, set the arguments, and execute the
 * the command:
 * <pre><code>
 *     CyCommandHandler handler = CyCommandManager.getCommand("view layout", "force-directed");
 *     Map<String,Tunable> layoutTunables = handler.getTunables("force-directed");
 *     Tunable t = layoutTunables.get("iterations");
 *     t.setValue("100");
 *     try {
 *       CyCommandResult layoutResult = handler.execute("force-directed", layoutTunables);
 *     } catch (CyCommandException e) {
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 * Alternatively....
 * <pre><code>
 *     Map<String,Object> args = new HashMap();
 *     args.put("iterations", new Integer(100));
 *     try {
 *       CyCommandHandler handler = CyCommandManager.execute("view layout", "force-directed", args);
 *     } catch (CyCommandException e) {
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
