/**
 * CyNetwork is the primary class for algorithm writing.&nbsp; All algorithms
 * should take a CyNetwork as input, and do their best to only use the API of
 * CyNetwork.&nbsp; Plugins that want to affect the display of a graph can look
 * into using CyNetworkView as well.<br>
 * <br>
 * A CyNetwork can create Nodes or Edges.&nbsp; Any Nodes or Edges that wish to
 * be added to a CyNetwork firt need to be created in <span style="font-style:
 * italic;">Cytoscape.</span>&nbsp; <br>
 * <br>
 * The methods that are defined by CyNetwork mostly deal with data integration
 * and flagging of nodes/edges.&nbsp; All methods that deal with graph traversal
 * are part of the inherited API of the GraphPerspective class.&nbsp; Links to
 * which can be found at the bottom of the methods list.&nbsp; <br>
 * <br>
 * In general, all methods are supported for working with Nodes/Edges as
 * objects, and as indices.<br>
