This directory contains plugins that are not core plugins.

The definition of core plugin is:
1. Sits in the cytoscape/plugins directory in CVS
2. Is part of Cytoscape planning and testing (project plan, release
testing, packaging).

In other words, plugins in this directory will not be bundled with
Cytoscape release builds.  They will perhaps be available to end-users
via download from cytoscape.org website.
