This InstallAnywhere project file is based on the installer created after
the official 2.1 release, and uses a local, pulled-down release as its
source for files.

This project file will have to be modified to work in the release/build
area - mostly realigning paths (e.g, setting build output area to be the
build/ directory, get files from release area, etc.)
