<h1 class="western">Quick Tour of Cytoscape</h1>
When a network is loaded, Cytoscape
will look something the image below:<br>
<p class="western" align="center"><img
 src="images/Cytoscape2_0Manual_html_63767327.png" name="Graphic3"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 500px; height: 475px;"
 alt="Cytoscape Desktop"></p>
<p class="western" align="left">The main window here has several components:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The menu bar at the top (See below
for more information about each menu item).</li>
  <li>The toolbar, which contains icons
for commonly used functions. These functions are also available via the
menus. Hover the mouse pointer over an icon and wait momentarily for a
description to appear as a tooltip.</li>
  <li>The network management panel
(top-left).  This contains an optional network overview pane(bottom-left
overview of the network).</li>
  <li>The main network view window, which
displays the network.</li>
   <li> The attribute browser panel (bottom panel) which displays attributes of selected nodes
   and edges and enables you to modify the values of attributes.
</ol>
<p>
The network management and attribute browser panels are dockable tabbed panels known as CytoPanels.  You can undock any of these panels by clicking on the Float Window control in the upper-right corner of the CytoPanel.
<p class="western" align="center"><img
 src="images/FloatWindowControl.png" name="Graphic3"
 alt="FloatWindowControl"></p>
<p>
If you select this control, e.g. on the attribute browser panel, you will now have two Cytoscape windows, the main window, and a new window labeled CytoPanel 2, similar to the one shown below. 
<p class="western" align="center"><img
 src="images/CytoPanel2.png" name="Graphic3"
 alt="CytoPanel2"></p>
 
<p>
Note that CytoPanel 2 now has a Dock Window control. If you select this control, the window will dock onto the main window.
<p>
Cytoscape also has a set of editors that enable you to build and modify networks interactively by dragging and dropping nodes and edges from a palette onto the main network view window. The editors can be invoked using the Set Editor command on the File menu.  An example of a simple biomolecule editor, with the palette contained in CytoPanel 1, is shown below.
<p class="western" align="center"><img

<h2><a name="menus"></a>The Menus</h2>
<h3>File Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img
 src="images/FileMenu.png" name="FileMenu"
<b></b><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>File</u> menu contains most
basic file functionality: <u>File / Load</u> for loading a variety of
file types; <u>File / Save</u> for saving. File/Help displays a
credits screen. <u>File / Print</u> allows printing. <u>File / Export
As...</u> allows you to export to a file in a number of graphics
formats (such as PDF). <u>File / Exit</u>
closes all windows of Cytoscape and exits the program. 
<u>File/New</u> opens up a New network for editing. 
This menu item is disabled until an editor is chosen using the <u> File /SetEditor</u> menu item.
</p>
<h3>Edit Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img src="images/EditMenu.png"
 alt="Edit Menu" >
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The
<u>Edit</u> menu <u>Undo</u> and <u>Redo</u> menu items which undo and redo edits made in 
the Attribute Browser. The menu also contains a Squiggle feature that enables you 
to mark up your network. This can be particularly useful during live presentations. 
There are also options for creating and destroying views (graphical representations of a 
network) and networks (the network data – not yet visualized), as well as an option for 
deleting selected nodes and edges from the current network. All deleted nodes and edges 
can be restored to the network via the <u>Edit/Restore Deleted Nodes/Edges</u> menu item.  
The Edit Menu also supports <u>Preferences</u> editing for properties and plug-ins via a 
Preferences Dialog. Preferences editing operates on the cytoscape.props file associated 
with the user’s instance of Cytoscape. See “Command Line Arguments and Properties” for more 
information.


<br>
</p>
<h3>Data Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img
 src="images/DataMenu.png" name="DataMenu"
  alt=""><b></b><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>Data</u> menu allows you to display or hide the network management panel (CytoPanel 1). It allows you to display or hide the attribute browser (CytoPanel 2), which lets you view and edit attributes assigned to both nodes and edges. (See section 7. Node and Edge Attributes) 
The <u>Data</u> menu allows you to display an advanced window (contents of CytoPanel 3). 
</p>
<h3>Select Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img
 src="images/SelectMenu.png" name="Select Menu"
  alt=""><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>Select</u> menu contains
methods
and operations for selecting nodes and edges, and using the current
selection to create a new network and an associated view.
</p>
<h3>Layout Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img
 src="images/LayoutMenu.png" name="Layout Menu"
  alt=""><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>Layout</u> menu has an array of
features for organizing the network visually according to one of
several algorithms, aligning and rotating groups of nodes, and
adjusting the size of the network. Most of these features are
available from plugins that are packaged with Cytoscape 2.2
</p>
<h3>Visualization Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img
 src="images/VisualizationMenu.png" name="Visualization Menu"
  alt=""><b></b><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>Visualization</u> menu provides
options for changing the mapping from biological data to a visual
representation: colors of nodes, thickness of edges, etc. These
features are explored in-depth in the <i>9. Visual Styles</i>
section. This menu also provides an Overview (Bird&#8217;s Eye view) of
your entire network, which is helpful for navigating very large
networks.
</p>
<h3>PlugIns Menu</h3>
<p class="western" align="left"><img src="images/PluginsMenu.png"
 alt="Plugins Menu" >
</p>
<p class="western" align="left">The <u>PlugIns</u>
menu has menu entries or choices added by plugins that have been
loaded, such as "Import BioPAX Document from file". <br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:
A list of Cytoscape PlugIns with
descriptions is available online at: </span><span

The <u>Help</u> menu allows you to
launch the online help viewer and browse the table of contents
(Contents&#8230;), or view the help text associated with a
context-sensitive selection (Context Sensitive&#8230;). By selecting
Context Sensitive&#8230; menu item and then selecting a GUI component,
the help related to the selected item is launched. The &#8220;About&#8230;&#8221;
menu item displays information about the running version of
Cytoscape.<br>
<br>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<img src="images/FiltersMenu.png" title="Filters Menu" alt="Filters Menu"
><br>
This menu allows you to bring up a user interface for defining and running 
filters (see <em>10. Filters</em>). Filters enable you to extract subnetworks 
based upon the values of node and edge attributes.
<p>
Additional menus may appear, depending on the set of Plugins you have chosen to load.

<span
 style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<h2><a name="network-view-manager"></a>The Network Management Window</h2>
Cytoscape 2.2 allows multiple
networks to be loaded at a time, either with or without a view. A
network stores all the nodes and edges that are loaded by the user
and a view displays them. You can have many views of the same
network. Networks (and their optionally associated views) can be
organized hierarchically.
<br>
<br>
An example where a number of
networks have been loaded and arranged hierarchically is shown below:
<p class="western" align="center"><img
 src="images/Cytoscape2_0Manual_html_3d2e92f0.png" name="Graphic11"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 500px; height: 416px;"
 alt="Network Management Window"></p>
<br>
The network manager (top-left tree view in CytoPanel1) shows the networks that are loaded. Clicking on a network
here will make that view active in the main window, if the view
exists (green highlighted networks only). Each network has a name
and size (number of nodes and edges), which are shown in the network
manager. If a network is loaded from a file, the network name is the
name of the file. <br>
<br>
Since some networks are very large
(thousands of nodes and edges) and can take a long time to display. For
this reason, a network in Cytoscape may not contain a &#8216;view&#8217;.
Networks that have a view are highlighted in green and networks that
don&#8217;t have a view are highlighted in red. You can create or
destroy a view for a network by right-clicking the network name in
the network manager or by choosing the appropriate option in the edit
menu. You can also destroy previously loaded networks this way. In
the picture above, seven networks are loaded, six green ones with
views and one red one without a view.
<br>
<br>
Certain operations in Cytoscape will
create new networks. If a new network is created from an old
network, for example by selecting a set of nodes in one network and
copying these nodes to a new network (via the Select-&gt;To New
Network option), it will be shown as a child of the network that it
was derived from. In this way, the relationships between networks
that are loaded in Cytoscape can be seen at a glance.  Networks in the top part of
the tree in the figure above were generated in this manner.
<br>
<br>
The available network views are also arranged as multiple, overlapping windows
in the network view window. You can maximize, minimize, and destroy network views by using familiar 
window controls.
<h3 class="western">The Network Overview Window</h3>
The network overview window shows an
overview (or &#8216;bird&#8217;s eye view&#8217;) of the network. It can be used
to navigate around a large network view. This feature can be turned
on an off via the Visualization menu. The red-outlined blue rectangle
in the overview window shown below can be dragged with the mouse to
navigate to a part of the network. The size of the navigation
rectangle depends on the size of the active view and the zoom level
of the view. The rectangle is smaller if the view is zoomed in and
larger if zoomed out.
