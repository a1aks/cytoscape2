  <title>Building and Storing Interaction Networks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Using a Cytoscape editor, you can build a network interactively 
by adding nodes and edges to a drawing canvas.  In addition to building a new network, you can also edit existing networks 
by adding and deleting nodes and edges.
<p>
To bring up an editor, use the <b>File->Set Editor</b> menu item.  You will be given a choice of three editors, 
the <em>DefaultCytoscapeEditor</em>, the <em>SimpleBioMoleculeEditor</em>, and the <em>SimpleBioPAX_Editor</em>.
If there is no current view at the time you make the <b>File->Set Editor</b>, then a new network 
and view will be created automatically for you.
<p>
To start editing a new network, use the <b>File->New->Network</b> menu item.
<p>
The figure shows shows the display for the <em>DefaultCytoscapeEditor</em>.

<p>
Adding nodes and edges is done from a palette (left panel of figure) whose elements are defined by the current Visual Style.
The palette contains a set of shapes (for nodes) and arrows (for edges).  
<p>
To add a node to a network, click on a shape on the palette, then drag and drop the shape onto the canvas.
<p>
To connect two nodes with an edge, click on an arrow on the palette, then drag and drop the arrow onto a node on the canvas.  This node becomes
the source node of the edge.  
Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established.  
<p>
You can abort the drawing of the edge by clicking on an empty spot on the palette.
<p>
The shapes and colors of the
of the node elements on the palette map to the shapes and colors for different node types defined 
by the visual style.  The line type and target arrow map to the line type and
target arrow defined by the visual style.  Note that if you change the Visual Style, the palette used 
by the current network view will also change to be consistent with the mappings in the new Visual Style.
<p>
There is also an <b>Edit => Connect Selected Nodes</b> menu item that, when chosen, 
creates a clique amongst the selected nodes.  
<p>
The editor also provides accelerators for adding nodes and edges.  
Control-clicking at a position on the canvas creates a node at that position.  
Control-clicking on a node on the canvas starts an edge with source at that node.  Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established.  
You can abort the drawing of the edge by control-clicking on an empty spot on the palette.
<p>
You can  delete nodes and edges by selecting a number of nodes and edges, then selecting the 
<b>Edit => Delete Selected Nodes and Edges</b> menu item.
You can recover any nodes and edges deleted from a network by selecting the
<b>Edit => Restore Deleted Nodes and Edges</b> menu item.  Note that this will restore <b>all</b> nodes and edges 
that were previously deleted from the network, not just those deleted by the most recent delete operation.
