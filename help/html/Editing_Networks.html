  <title>Building and Storing Interaction Networks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Cytoscape has a set of editors that enable you to build and modify networks interactively 
by dragging and dropping nodes and edges from a palette onto the main network view window. 
The palette contains a set of shapes (for nodes) and arrows (for edges).  
The shapes on the palette are defined by the current Visual Style, with Node Shape and Node Color
mapping into the shape and color of a node, and Edge Target Arrow mapping into the target arrow 
of an edge.
An example of an editor, with the palette contained in CytoPanel 1, is shown below.

<p>
To bring up an editor, use the <b>File->Set Editor</b> menu item.  In this 
version of Cytoscape, you will be given a choice of 
three editors, 
<ul>
<li> a <em>DefaultCytoscapeEditor</em>, which contains one default node and one default edge
on its palette.  This editor will define the nodes and shapes on its palette using the current 
Visual Style.
<li> a <em>SimpleBioMoleculeEditor</em>, which defines the nodes and shapes on its palette 
using the SimpleBioMolecule Visual Style.  
<li> a <em>SimpleBioPAX_Editor</em>, defines the nodes and shapes on its palette 
using a Visual Style that maps node shapes and colors according to the value of the
"BIOPAX_NODE_TYPE" attribute and maps edge target arrows according to the value
of the "BIOPAX_EDGE_TYPE" attribute.  Note that, in this version of Cytoscape, the 
<em>SimpleBioPAX_Editor</em> is <b>not</b> a fully functional BioPAX editor, but rather 
serves as an example.  Moreover, there is no facility for output to BioPAX format in the
current version of Cytoscape.  A fully functional BioPAX editor, with output to BioPAX format, is
planned for a future version of Cytoscape.
</ul>
<p>
When you bring up an editor, the visual style for the current network view is set to the visual
style that is associated with the editor. 
If there is no current view at the time you make the <b>File->Set Editor</b>, then a new network 
and view (and network) will be created automatically for you.
<p>
To start editing a new network, use the <b>File->New->Network</b> menu item.
<p>
The figure below shows shows the display for the <em>DefaultCytoscapeEditor</em>.

<p>
To add a node to a network, drag and drop a node shape from the palette onto the canvas.
<p>
To connect two nodes with an edge, drag and drop an arrow shape onto a node on the canvas.  This node becomes
the source node of the edge.  
Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Click the mouse while over this node and the connection is established.  
<p>
You can abort the drawing of the edge by clicking on an empty spot on the palette.
<p>
Note that if you change the Visual Style, the palette used 
by the current network view will also change to be consistent with the mappings in the new Visual Style.
<p>
There is also an <b>Edit => Connect Selected Nodes</b> menu item that, when chosen, 
creates a clique amongst the selected nodes.  
<p>
The editor provides accelerators for adding nodes and edges.  
Control-clicking at a position on the canvas creates a node at that position.
The NODE_TYPE attribute of the node will be the same as the NODE_TYPE of the node most recently added, defaulting
to "DefaultNode" type.  
In this manner, you can use control-clicking as a kind of "stamp" to add multiple nodes of the 
same type to the network.
Control-clicking on a node on the canvas starts an edge with source at that node.  Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established.
The EDGE_TYPE attribute of the edge will be the same as the EDGE_TYPE of the edge most recently added, defaulting
to "DefaultEdge" type.    
You can abort the drawing of the edge by control-clicking on an empty spot on the palette.
<p>
You can  delete nodes and edges by selecting a number of nodes and edges, then selecting the 
<b>Edit => Delete Selected Nodes and Edges</b> menu item.
You can recover any nodes and edges deleted from a network by selecting the
<b>Edit => Restore Deleted Nodes and Edges</b> menu item.  Note that this will restore <b>all</b> nodes and edges 
that were previously deleted from the network, not just those deleted by the most recent delete operation.
