<p>
<b>DISCLAIMER: This is preliminary documentation, meant solely for purposes
of testing the CytoscapeEditor.  Contents will change as functionality changes during testing.
More comprehensive Help documentation will be provided for the Cytoscape 2.2 release.</b>
<p>
A new feature in Cytoscape version 2.2 is network editing, which allows you to build a network interactively 
by adding nodes and edges to a drawing canvas.  In addition to building a new network, you can also edit existing networks 
by adding and deleting nodes and edges.
<p>
To bring up an editor, use the <b>File->Set Editor</b> menu item.  You will be given a choice of three editors, 
the <em>BasicCytoscapeEditor</em>, the <em>SimpleBioMoleculeEditor</em>, and the <em>SimpleBioPAX_Editor</em>.
<p>
To start editing a new network, use the <b>File->New->Network</b> menu item.
<p>
The <b>BasicCytoscapeEditor</b> provides base level graph editing functionality through a set of buttons on the Cytoscape
toolbar, shown in the figure below.
<p>
<img src="images/EditorButtons.gif" name="editorButtons" align="bottom" border="0"><br>
<p>The buttons, from left to right, are <em>Reset Cursor</em>, <em>Add Node</em>, and <em>Connect Nodes</em>.
Click on the <em>Add Node</em> button and the cursor takes on a 
circular shape, the system goes into "add" mode, and subsequent clicking of mouse on canvas creates 
nodes with default labels.  In this sense, the cursor functions as a "stamp" for new nodes.
<p>
Click on the <em>Connect Nodes</em> button, and the system goes into "connect mode, 
where the cursor changes to a <em>connector</em> icon.  Clicking on a node on the canvas starts an edge with source at that node.  
Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node. 
Then click the mouse and an edge that connects the two nodes will be be added to the canvas.
<p>
There is also an "Edit => Connect Selected Nodes" menu item that, when chosen, 
creates a clique amongst the selected nodes.  
<p> 
Going back out of "add" or "connect" modes is accomplished by pressing the <em>Reset Cursor</em> button on the toolbar
<p>
The <b>BasicCytoscapeEditor</b> also provides accelerators for modeless addition of nodes and edges.  
Control-clicking at a position on the canvas creates a node with default label in that position.  
Control-clicking on a node on the canvas starts an edge with source at that node.  Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established.  
<p>
You can also delete nodes and edges by selecting a number of nodes and edges, then selecting the Right Mouse menu item 
<b>Delete Selected Nodes and Edges</b>.
<p>
You can undo an add or delete operation by selecting the <b>Edit->Undo</b> menu item.  After performing an undo, you can redo the undone operation by 
selecting the <b>Edit->Redo</b> menu item.  There are multiple levels of undo and redo.  There are also 
the conventional keyboard accelerators: Control-Z for undo and
Control-Y for redo.
<p>
The figure below shows the BasicCytoscapeEditor, which is driven by controls in the toolbar.

<p>
Cytoscape 2.2 also provides two "palette-based" editors, <b>SimpleBioMoleculeEditor</b>, and <b>SimpleBioPAX_Editor</b>.
These contain palettes of shapes (for nodes) and arrows (for edges) which are constructed using the Cytoscape Visual Style 
facility.  Each of the two palette-based editors is associated with a visual style of the same name.
<p>
To add a node to a network, click on a shape on the palette, then drag and drop the shape onto the canvas.
<p>
To connect two nodes with an edge, click on an arrow on the palette, then drag and drop the arrow onto a node on the canvas.  This node becomes
the source node of the edge.  Connecting to a target node works in the same manner as in the <b>BasicCytoscapeEditor</b>.  
Move the cursor and a 
rubber-banded line follows the cursor.  As the cursor passes over another node, that node is
highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node.  
Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established.  
<p>
The figures below show several examples of the usage of the palette-based editors.
The first figure shows shows the display for the SimpleBioMoleculeEditor.
It also shows an edit to canonical name for Node0, performed in the Cytoscape attribute browser/editor and reflected in the CytoscapeEditor.

The first figure shows a hand-drawn BioPAX network, copied from Ethan Cerami's "biopax-sample1" example.

The second figure shows the "biopax-sample1" example, loaded into Cytoscape, then modified with the addition of two new nodes and interactions.
