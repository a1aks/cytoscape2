Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. A software &#8220;Core&#8221; provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular state information; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. <span class="strong">The central organizing metaphor of Cytoscape is a network (graph), with genes, proteins, and molecules represented as nodes and interactions represented as links, i.e. edges, between nodes.</span>

    <span class="strong">Development</span>
   </span> Cytoscape is a collaborative project between the Institute for Systems Biology (Dr. Leroy Hood), the University of California San Diego (Dr. Trey Ideker), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (Dr. Chris Sander) and the Institut Pasteur (Dr. Benno Schwikowski). </p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org" target="_top">http://www.cytoscape.org</a> for more information. </p><p>

    <span class="strong">What&#8217;s New in 2.3</span>
   </span>
  </p><p>Cytoscape version 2.3. contains several new features, plus improvements to the performance and usability of the software. These include: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>A much faster rendering engine.  Cytoscape can now render at interactive speed graphs with over 100,000 nodes and edges. </li><li>The ability to save a session.  You can now save all of your work in Cytoscape to a single file. When re-opened, this file will return Cytoscape to the state in which you left it including all networks, attributes, and properties. </li><li>A node grouping plugin.  This will allow one node to contain and display subnetworks. </li><li>Enhanced Undo/Redo support. </li><li>An enhanced attribute browser. </li><li>An enhanced Ontology Server Wizard. </li><li>An improved command line interface. </li><li>The ability to rename networks. </li><li><p>The <a href="/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/GraphMerge" target="_top">GraphMerge</a> plugin included by default. </p></li><li>Enhanced context or pop-up menus for nodes. </li><li>Many performance improvements and bug fixes. </li><li>A rewritten "bird's eye view" of the network that is enabled by default. </li><li>The ability to load expression data according to node attribute (such as a commercial probeset identifier) instead of ndoe ID. </li></ul></div><p>
