I.  Doing a Clean Checkout
==========================

If this is the first time reading this, make sure that you have done a clean checkout.  To
do this, create a backup of your local installation of cytoscape.  Then, set your CVSROOT environment
variable to point to:  /common/cvsdir5.

Then, do a clean check-out:

cvs checkout -P cytoscape

II.  New Directory Structure
============================

Cytoscape now contains the following directory structure:

cytoscape
   +
   +---bin/       Contains all OS specific scripts, e.g. shell scripts and batch files.
   +
   +---build/     This directoy is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain all generated class files.
   +
   +---config/    Contains all configuration files, e.g. cytoscape.props.
   +
   +---cytodocs/  Contains all technical documentation.
   +
   +---dist/      This directory is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain cytoscape.jar.
   +
   +---images/    Contains image files
   +
   +---legacy/    Contains legacy files which will no longer be supported.
   +
   +---lib/       Contains all JAR files.
   +
   +---src/       Contains all source .java files.
   +
   +---testData/  Contains all test data
   +
   +---tools/     Contains misc. tools for cytoscape distribution.
   +
   +---user_docs/ Contains all user documentation and manuals.

III. New Build Process
======================

To build cytoscape:

1.  Download and install Jakarta Ant.  Download from:  http://ant.apache.org/.  Installation instructions
are available at:  http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html.

2.  To compile cytoscape, type:

ant

3.  To run cytoscape, type:

ant run

If cytoscape appears, everything is set up correctly!

IV.  Building Cytoscape Plug-Ins
================================

Cytoscape plug-ins are expected to have their own ant build.xml files that can be used to
build JAR files for each plugin.  Also, cytoscape/plugins contains stable plugins that are
made available with the official Cytoscape release.

For old Cytoscape 1.1 plug-ins, you might have to follow these directions:

The csplugins directory uses the same build process as before.  To compile csplugins,
you therefore need to do the following:

define your java CLASSPATH to include at least

    <full-path-to-current-directory>/build/classes
    <full-path-to-current-directory>/lib/cyto-aux.jar
    <full-path-to-current-directory>/lib/y.jar
    <full-path-to-current-directory>/lib/junit.jar
    <full-path-to-immediate-parent-directory>

then, cd to csplugins, and type:

  make
