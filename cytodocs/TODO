* Plugin loading should be contingent on currently loaded files.  Thus, everytime 
a new gml, sif, or expression file is loaded, we should recheck and load plugins.

* Decrease the amount of debug output to STDOUT.  We should probably have an
official "verbose" or "debug" mode, that could even take a debug level, etc.

* Allow loading of the bioDataServer directory interactively from the file menu.

* The PlugIns menu should be inactive if no plugs loaded

* Save Visible Nodes...

Owen and Trey,

Thanks for your comments, those will be very helpful. Specifically
regarding the active paths component, I had a couple of questions:

1. What other parameters should be added for the user to set? A few we
thought of were

   (a) ability to select scoring systems - note that this can get
       complicated if different versions have different control parameters
       (for example, how many components to use in comparing the total path
       score). Also

    (b) the number of groups desired (or threshold on score) and (c) the
        frequency of partial updates (see also below). Any others?

2. What are reasonable defaults and ranges for the parameters? I
think what we came up with was some average or median of the scores
for lambda_c, starting temperature of 5*lambda_c, ending temperature
of 0.1*lambda_c, and the temperature increment calculated from the
number of steps requested. For the number of steps, it seems like
anything from a few (for debugging purposes) to ~10^4 (for small
networks) to 10^7 (for large runs on large networks) could be
reasonable. What else would you suggest?


   Also, some comments on your suggestions:

       ACTIVE PATHS
       ------------
       * There should probably be a throttle indicating how many groups
        the algorithm should track.


I thought of this. The advantage would come when searching the list
and map of scores for a component.  However, these structures are
always sorted, so searching is an O(log N) operation. Also, there's
notational convenience of having all "on" nodes be in an existing
component when considering "toggle on" moves that require searching
for active neighbors. In the end, I decided it was easier to keep all
the components in a sorted structure, and output only the top ones if
desired.

       * It would be nice if the screen updated with some frequency to
        indicate that the algorithm *is* running, and how it's doing.
        You would be able to decide how many thousands of iterations
        it should run between screen updates, as in the old program.

This is in the works. The idea is to set up a callback function
design in the algorithm, and implement the updating on the java side
as a callback function.

Trey and I spent some time playing with the software, and we didn't
notice any defects/bugs during our brief experience with it. Looks
good! Everything that's there seems pretty functional. I like the
"circular" and "organic" layouts. Did they come with the Java
toolkit being used? 

So we drew up a list of things that are present in the C++
implementation, and absent in the current Java implementation, acked
on a few things that shouldn't be hard but would be useful, and here t
is, grouped into a few categories:

(note: you may already have some of these things fixed, with the UI
improvements you were mentioning. anyway, here we go.)


BIO-PROPS
---------
 * Can there be a dialog for changing node size on the fly?
 * Also, font size for node labels?
 * Also, node shape, (by type of node if there were multiple types)?
 * Option to display gene common names, when possible?

GENE INFO
---------
 * Web/proteome pop-up on a per-gene basis, probably out of
   the Gene Information pop-up. Note that I made up the name
   Gene Information, there should probably be a title on that
    window.

 * Making gene common names/synonyms appear in the table of
   popup Gene Information, so you don't have to go all the way
   to GO to get it.

 * Matrix of gene expression info: when there are multiple genes
   selected, the only way to get their expression data is
   one-at-a-time; that's useful, but a matrix might be more useful
   still, and not that hard to implement! What do you think?

 * When you search for genes whose names that start with some
   string, that search takes an unbelievable amount of time.
   I'm not sure why that would be, not yet having looked at the
   source. On the current network, try searching for "GAL" - it
   takes longer than an Active Paths run!

ACTIVE PATHS
------------
 * There should probably be a throttle indicating how many groups
   the algorithm should track.

 * It would be nice if the screen updated with some frequency to
   indicate that the algorithm *is* running, and how it's doing.
   You would be able to decide how many thousands of iterations
   it should run between screen updates, as in the old program.

FILE IO
-------
 * We could use the capacity to read in raw interaction data,
   of the form "A pp B", etc. Maybe the "Files of type"
   dialog needs some formats to list.
 * We should also be able to load in a new set of conditions
   and expression data in the middle of using the program.

UI
--
 * It would be great to have a way to navigate the 2D workspace
   without using the scrollbars. Would clicking with some mouse
   button and dragging the workspace around be possible?

  * We should probably have a Version number in there, so that
    when I make comments, or anyone does, we can ask which version
    they're using, tag the CVS files appropriately, and figure out
    whether we've already fixed the thing they're talking about.
    This might apply to some of the comments we've made already.
