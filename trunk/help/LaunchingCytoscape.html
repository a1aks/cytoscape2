   <span class="strong">System requirements:</span> The system requirements for Cytoscape depend on the size of the networks the user wants to load, view and manipulate. We recommend a recent computer (1GHz CPU or higher) with a high-end graphics card and at least 512MB of free physical RAM. Cytoscape expects a minimum screen resolution of 1024x768. </p><p>There are a number of options for downloading and installing Cytoscape: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>For Windows and Linux platforms, one-step installation is available via <span class="emphasis"><em>
      <a href="/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/InstallAnywhere" target="_top">InstallAnywhere</a>
     </em></span>. For one-step installation, go to <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org" target="_top">http://www.cytoscape.org</a>, click Download Cytoscape, and follow the on-screen instructions. </p></li><li>For Mac OS X, we provide an alternative installation, available as a .dmg.zip file. When installed via this method, Cytoscape functions as a regular Mac application, and can be accessed via your Applications folder. </li><li>Finally, you can download and install a compressed archive distribution. Instructions for this option are provided below. </li></ul></div><p>
   <span class="strong"> (1)</span>
   <span class="strong">Download and unpack the distribution.</span> Cytoscape is distributed as a compressed archive (tar.gz or zip) containing the following files and directories: </p><p></p><pre class="screen">

   <span class="strong">(2) If necessary, install Java.</span> If not already installed on your computer, download and install the Java 2 Runtime Environment, version 1.4.2 or higher. It can be found at: </p><p>
   <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a>
  </p><p>
   <span class="strong">(3) Launch the application </span>by running "cytoscape.sh" from the command line (Linux or Mac OS X) or double-clicking "cytoscape.bat" (Windows). Alternatively, you can pass the .jar file to Java directly using the command "java -Xmx512M -jar cytoscape.jar -p plugins". The <span class="emphasis"><em>-Xmx512M</em></span> flag tells java to allocate more memory for Cytoscape and the <span class="emphasis"><em>-p plugins</em></span> option tells cytoscape to load all of the plugins in the plugins directory.  Loading the plugins is important because many key features like layouts, filters and the attribute browser are included with Cytoscape as plugins in the <span class="emphasis"><em>plugins</em></span> directory. See the Command Line chapter for more detail. In Windows, it is also possible to directly double-click the .jar file to launch it. However, this does not allow specification of command-line arguments (such as the location of the plugin directory). On <span class="strong">Mac OS X</span>, users who downloaded the Mac OS X version of Cytoscape, can double-click on the Cytoscape icon to start Cytoscape. Either double-clicking or dragging onto the Cytoscape application icon any .sif or .gml file will load that file into Cytoscape. </p><div class="table"><a name="id2722414"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. </b></p><div class="caption"></div><table border="1"><colgroup><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>
        <span class="strong">Important Note:</span> For the application to work properly, all files should be left in the directory in which they were unpacked. The core Cytoscape application assumes this directory structure when looking for the various libraries needed to run the application.  If you are adventurous, you can get creative with the $CLASSPATH and/or the cytoscape.jar manifest file and run Cytoscape from any location you want. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
   <span class="strong">Cytoscape Window</span> When you succeed in launching Cytoscape, a window will appear that looks like this: </p><p>
