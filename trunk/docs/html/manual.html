Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. A software “Core” provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular state information; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. <span class="strong"><strong>The central organizing metaphor of Cytoscape is a network (graph), with genes, proteins, and molecules represented as nodes and interactions represented as links, i.e. edges, between nodes.</strong></span> </p><p><span class="underline"><span class="strong"><strong>Development</strong></span></span> Cytoscape is a collaborative project between the Institute for Systems Biology (Dr. Leroy Hood), the University of California San Diego (Dr. Trey Ideker), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (Dr. Chris Sander) and the Institut Pasteur (Dr. Benno Schwikowski). </p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org" target="_top">http://www.cytoscape.org</a> for more information. </p><p><span class="underline"><span class="strong"><strong>License</strong></span></span> Cytoscape is protected under the GNU LGPL (Lesser General Public License).

Alternatively, you can pass the .jar file to Java directly using the command "java -Xmx512M -jar cytoscape.jar -p plugins". The <span class="emphasis"><em>-Xmx512M</em></span> flag tells java to allocate more memory for Cytoscape and the <span class="emphasis"><em>-p plugins</em></span> option tells cytoscape to load all of the plugins in the plugins directory.  Loading the plugins is important because many key features like layouts, filters and the attribute browser are included with Cytoscape as plugins in the <span class="emphasis"><em>plugins</em></span> directory. See the Command Line chapter for more detail. In Windows, it is also possible to directly double-click the .jar file to launch it. However, this does not allow specification of command-line arguments (such as the location of the plugin directory). On <span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></span>, users who downloaded the Mac OS X version of Cytoscape, can double-click on the Cytoscape icon to start Cytoscape.

A network stores all the nodes and edges that are loaded by the user and a view displays them. You can have many views of the same network. Networks (and their optionally associated views) can be organized hierarchically. </p><p>An example where a number of networks have been loaded and arranged hierarchically is shown below: </p><p>[attachment:cytoscape_network_heirarchy.png] </p><p>The network manager (top-right tree view in <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/CytoPanel" target="_top">CytoPanel</a> 1) shows the networks that are loaded. Clicking on a network here will make that view active in the main window, if the view exists (green highlighted networks only). Each network has a name and size (number of nodes and edges), which are shown in the network manager. If a network is loaded from a file, the network name is the name of the file. </p><p>Some networks are very large (thousands of nodes and edges) and can take a long time to display. For this reason, a network in Cytoscape may not contain a ‘view’. Networks that have a view are highlighted in green and networks that don’t have a view are highlighted in red. You can create or destroy a view for a network by right-clicking the network name in the network manager or by choosing the appropriate option in the edit menu. You can also destroy previously loaded networks this way. In the picture above, seven networks are loaded, six green ones with views and one red one without a view. </p><p>Certain operations in Cytoscape will create new networks. If a new network is created from an old network, for example by selecting a set of nodes in one network and copying these nodes to a new network (via the <span class="underline">File → New → Network</span> option), it will be shown as a child of the network that it was derived from. In this way, the relationships between networks that are loaded in Cytoscape can be seen at a glance. Networks in the top part of the tree in the figure above were generated in this manner. </p><p>The available network views are also arranged as multiple, overlapping windows in the network view window. You can maximize, minimize, and destroy network views by using the normal window controls for your operating system. </p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="The Network Overview Window"/>The Network Overview Window</h3></div></div></div><p>The network overview window shows an overview (or ‘bird’s eye view’) of the network. It can be used to navigate around a large network view. This feature can be turned on or off via the <span class="underline">View → Show/Hide Network Overview</span> menu. The blue rectangle in the overview window shown below can be dragged with the mouse to navigate to a part of the network. The size of the navigation rectangle depends on the size of the active view and the zoom level of the view. The rectangle is smaller if the view is zoomed in and larger if zoomed out. </p><p>[attachment:network_overview.png] </p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><a id="command_line_args"/></li></ul></div><p/><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Command Line Arguments"/>Command Line Arguments</h2></div></div></div><div class="table"><a id="d0e482"/><p class="title"><b>Table 4. </b></p><div class="table-contents"><div class="caption"/><table border="1"><colgroup><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="strong"><strong>Important!</strong></span> The command line arguments have changed in version 2.3, so please read this section carefully. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"/><p>Cytoscape recognizes a number of optional command line arguments, including run-time specification of network files, attribute files, and session files.

SIF specifies nodes and interactions only, while GML and XGMML store additional information about network layout and allows network data exchange with a variety of other network display programs. Typically, SIF is used to import interactions when building a network for the first time, since it is easy to create in a text editor or spreadsheet. Once the interactions have been loaded and layout has been performed, the network may be saved to and subsequently reloaded from GML or XGMML format in future Cytoscape sessions.  SIF, GML, and XGMML are text files and you can edit and view them in a regular text editor. Additionally, GML and XGMML are supported by some other network visualization tools. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>SIF FORMAT: </strong></span> </p><p>The simple interaction format is convenient for building a graph from a list of interactions. It also makes it easy to combine different interaction sets into a larger network, or add new interactions to an existing data set. The main disadvantage is that this format does not include any layout information, forcing Cytoscape to re-compute a new layout of the network each time it is loaded. </p><p>Lines in the SIF file specify a source node, a relationship type (or edge type), and one or more target nodes: </p><p/><pre class="screen">nodeA &lt;relationship type&gt; nodeB
nodeC &lt;relationship type&gt; nodeA
nodeD &lt;relationship type&gt; nodeE nodeF nodeB
nodeG
...
nodeY &lt;relationship type&gt; nodeZ
</pre><p>A more specific example is: </p><p/><pre class="screen">node1 typeA node2
node2 typeB node3 node4 node5
node0
</pre><p>The first line identifies two nodes, called node1 and node2, and a single relationship between node1 and node2 of type typeA. The second line specifies three new nodes, node3, node4, and node5; here "node2" refers to the same node as in the first line. The second line also specifies three relationships, all of type typeB and with node2 as the source, with node3, node4, and node5 as the targets, respectively. This second form is simply shorthand for specifying multiple relationships of the same type with the same source node. The third line indicates how to specify a node that has no relationships with other nodes. This form is not needed for nodes that do have relationships, since the specification of the relationship implicitly identifies the nodes as well. Duplicate entries are allowed and indicate multiple edges between the same nodes. For example, the following specifies three edges between the same pair of nodes, two of type pp and one of type pd: </p><p/><pre class="screen">node1 pp node2
node1 pp node2
node1 pd node2
</pre><p>Edges connecting a node to itself (self-edges) are also allowed: </p><p/><pre class="screen">node1 pp node1
</pre><p>Every node and edge in Cytoscape has an identifying name, most commonly used with the node and edge data attribute structures. Node names must be unique as identically named nodes will be treated as identical nodes. The name of each node will be the name in this file by default (unless another string is mapped to display on the node using the visual mapper. This is discussed in the section on visual styles. The name of each edge will be formed from the name of the source and target nodes plus the interaction type: for example, sourceName edgeType targetName. </p><p>The tag &lt;interaction type&gt; should be one of: </p><p/><pre class="screen">  pp .................. protein – protein interaction
  pd .................. protein -&gt; DNA
  (e.g. transcription factor binding upstream of a regulating gene.)
</pre><p>Any text string will work, but the above are the conventions that have been followed thus far. </p><p>Additional interaction types are also possible, but not widely used, e.g.: </p><p/><pre class="screen">  pr .................. protein -&gt; reaction
  rc .................. reaction -&gt; compound
  cr .................. compound -&gt; reaction
  gl .................. genetic lethal relationship
  pm .................. protein-metabolite interaction
  mp .................. metabolite-protein interaction
</pre><p>Even whole words or concatenated words may be used to define other types of relationships e.g. geneFusion, cogInference, pullsDown, activates, degrades, inactivates, inhibits, phosphorylates, upRegulates </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Delimiters</strong></span>. Whitespace (space or tab) is used to delimit the names in the simple interaction file format. However, in some cases spaces are desired in a node name or edge type. The standard is that, if the file contains any tab characters, then tabs are used to delimit the fields and spaces are considered part of the name. If the file contains no tabs, then any spaces are delimiters that separate names (and names cannot contain spaces). </p><p>If your network unexpectedly contains no edges and node names that look like edge names, it probably means your file contains a stray tab that's fooling the parser. On the other hand, if your network has nodes whose names are half of a full name, then you probably meant to use tabs to separate node names with spaces. </p><p>Networks in simple interactions format are often stored in files with a ".sif" extension, and Cytoscape recognizes this extension when browsing a directory for files of this type. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>GML FORMAT:</strong></span> </p><p>In contrast to SIF, GML is a rich graph format language supported by many other network visualization packages. The GML file format specification is available at: </p><p><a href="http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/" target="_top">http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/</a> </p><p>It is generally not necessary to modify the content of a GML file directly. Once a network is built in SIF format and then laid out, the layout is preserved by saving to and loading from GML. Visual attributes specified in a GML file will result in a new visual style named “<span class="emphasis"><em>Filename</em></span>.style” when that GML file is loaded. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>XGMML FORMAT:</strong></span> </p><p>XGMML is the XML evolution of GML and is based on the GML definition. The XGMML file format specification is available at: </p><p><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~puninj/XGMML/" target="_top">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~puninj/XGMML/</a> </p><p>XGMML is now preferred to GML because it offers the flexibility associated with all XML document types.  If you're unsure about which to use, choose XGMML. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>COMMANDS:</strong></span> </p><p>Load and save network files using the File menu of Cytoscape. Network files may also be loaded directly from the command line using the –N option (works for SIF, GML, and XGMML). </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>FOR EXAMPLE:</strong></span> </p><p>To load a sample molecular interaction network in SIF format, use the menu <span class="underline">File → Import → Network</span>.<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span> In the resulting file dialog box, select the file “sampleData/galFiltered.sif”. After a few seconds, a small network of 331 nodes should appear in the main window. To load the same interaction network as a GML, use the menu: <span class="underline">File → Import → Network</span> again. In the resulting file dialog box, select the file “sampleData/galFiltered.gml”. Node and edge attribute files as well as expression data and extra annotation can be loaded as well. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>NODE NAMING ISSUES IN CYTOSCAPE:</strong></span> </p><p>Typically, genes are represented by nodes, and interactions (or other biological relationships) are represented by edges between nodes. For compactness, a gene also represents its corresponding protein. Nodes may also be used to represent compounds and reactions (or anything else) instead of genes. </p><p>If a network of genes or proteins is to be integrated with Gene Ontology (GO) annotation or gene expression data, the gene names must exactly match the names specified in the other data files. We strongly encourage naming genes and proteins by their systematic ORF name or standard accession number; common names may be displayed on the screen for ease of interpretation, so long as these are available to the program in the annotation directory or in a node attribute file. Cytoscape ships with all yeast ORF-to-common name mappings in a synonym table within the annotation/ directory. Other organisms will be supported in the future. </p><p>Why do we recommend using standard gene names? All of the external data formats recognized by Cytoscape provide data associated with particular names of particular objects. For example, a network of protein-protein interactions would list the names of the proteins, and the attribute and expression data would likewise be indexed by the name of the object. </p><p>The problem is in connecting data from different data sources that don't necessarily use the same name for the same object. For example, genes are commonly referred to by different names, including a formal "location on the chromosome" identifier and one or more common names that are used by ordinary researchers when talking about that gene. Additionally, database identifiers from every database where the gene is stored may be used to refer to a gene (e.g. protein accession numbers from Swiss-Prot). If one data source uses the formal name while a different data source used a common name or identifier, then Cytoscape must figure out that these two different names really refer to the same biological entity. </p><p>Cytoscape has two strategies for dealing with this naming issue, one simple and one more complex. The simple strategy is to assume that every data source uses the same set of names for every object. If this is the case, then Cytoscape can easily connect all of the different data sources. </p><p>To handle data sources with different sets of names, as is usually the case when manually integrating gene information from different sources, Cytoscape needs a data server that provides synonym information (See<span class="emphasis"><em>12. Annotation.</em></span>). A synonym table gives a canonical name for each object in a given organism and one or more recognized synonyms for that object. Note that the synonym table itself defines what set of names are the "canonical" names. For example, in budding yeast the ORF names are commonly used as the canonical names. </p><p>If a synonym server is available, then by default Cytoscape will convert every name that appears in a data file to the associated canonical name. Unrecognized names will not be changed. This conversion of names to a common set allows Cytoscape to connect the genes present in different data sources, even if they have different names – as long as those names are recognized by the synonym server. </p><p>For this to work, Cytoscape must also be provided with the species to which the objects belong, since the data server requires the species in order to uniquely identify the object referred to by a particular name. This is usually done in Cytoscape by specifying the species name on the command line with the –P option (<code class="code">cytoscape.sh -P "defaultSpeciesName=Saccharomyces cerevisiae"</code>) or by editing the properties in the Preferences Dialog (<span class="underline">Edit → Preference...</span>). </p><p>The automatic canonicalization of names can be turned off using the -P option (<code class="code">cytoscape.sh -P canonicalizeName=false"</code>) or by editing the properties in the Preferences Dialog (<span class="underline">Edit → Preferences...</span>).  This canonicalization of names currently does not apply to expression data. Expression data should use the same names as the other data sources or use the canonical names as defined by the synonym table. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Loading Gene Expression (Attribute Matrix) Data"/>Loading Gene Expression (Attribute Matrix) Data</h2></div></div></div><p>Interaction networks are useful as stand-alone models. However, they are most powerful for answering scientific questions when integrated with additional biological information, such as gene or protein expression levels. Once loaded, expression ratios/levels may be visually superimposed on the network, used in a filter to select a subset of nodes, or used to identify active modules and subsystems (via plugin analysis tools). An expression data set can be loaded at any time, but are only relevant once a network has been loaded. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>FORMAT:</strong></span> Gene expression ratios or values are specified over one or more experiments using a text file. Ratios result from a comparison of two expression measurements (experiment vs. control). Some expression platforms, such as Affymetrix, directly measure expression values, without a comparison. The file consists of a header and a number of space- or tab-delimited fields, one line per gene, with the following format: </p><p/><pre class="screen">Identifier [CommonName] value1 value2 ... valueN [pval1 pval2 ... pvalN]
</pre><p>Brackets [ ] indicate fields that are optional. </p><p>The first field identifies which Cytoscape node the data refers to.  In the simplest case, this is the gene name - exactly  as it appears on the Cytoscape canvas (case sensitive!).  Alternatively, this can be some node attribute that identifies the node uniquely, such as a probeset identifier for commercial microarrays. </p><p>The next field is an optional common name.  It is not used by Cytoscape, and is provided strictly for the user's convenience. With this common name field, the input format is the same as for commonly-used expression data anaysis packages such as SAM (<a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/" target="_top">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/</a>). </p><p>The next set of columns represent expression values, one per experiment.  These can be either absolute expression values or fold change ratios.  Each experiment is identified by its experiment name, given in the first line. </p><p>Optionally, significance measures such as P values may be provided.  These values, generated by many microarray data analysis packages, indicate where the level of gene expression or the fold change appears to be greater than random chance.  If you are using significance measures, then your expression file should contain them in a second set of columns after the expression values.  The column names for the expression significance measures should match those of the expression values <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span>. </p><p>For example, here is an excerpt from the file galExpData.pvals in the Cytoscape sampleData directory:: </p><p/><pre class="screen">GENE COMMON gal1RG gal4RG gal80R gal1RG gal4RG gal80R

If present, this column will contain integer values indicating the number of conditions in which each gene had a statistically significant change according to some threshold. </p><p>The second format is similar to the first except that the duplicate column names are omitted, and there is no <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/NumSigConds" target="_top">NumSigConds</a> fields. This format specifies data with ratios but no significance values. </p><p>The third format specifies an MTX header, which is a commonly used format. Two tab characters precede the RATIOS token. This token is followed by a number of tabs equal to the number of conditions, followed by the LAMBDAS token. This format specifies both ratios and significance values. </p><p>Each line after the first is a data line with the following format: </p><p/><pre class="screen">FormalGeneName CommonGeneName ratio1 ratio2 ... [lambda1 lambda2 ...] [numSigConds]
</pre><p>The first two tokens are gene names. The names in the first column are the keys used for node name lookup; these names should be the same as the names used elsewhere in Cytoscape (i.e. in the SIF, GML, or XGMML files). Traditionally in the gene expression microarray community, who defined these file formats, the first token is expected to be the formal name of the gene (in systems where there is a formal naming scheme for genes), while the second is expected to be a synonym for the gene commonly used by biologists, although Cytoscape does not make use of the common name column. The next columns contain floating point values for the ratios, followed by columns with the significance values if specified by the header line. The final column, if specified by the header line, should contain an integer giving the number of significant conditions for that gene.  Missing values are not allowed and will confuse the parser. For example, using two consecutive tabs to indicate a missing value will not work; the parser will regard both tabs as a single delimiter and be unable to parse the line correctly. </p><p>Optionally, the last line of the file may be a special footer line with the following format: </p><p/><pre class="screen">NumSigGenes int1 int2 ...
</pre><p>This line specified the number of genes that were significantly differentially expressed in each condition. The first text token must be spelled exactly as shown; the rest of the line should contain one integer value for each experimental condition. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Node and Edge Attributes"/>Node and Edge Attributes</h2></div></div></div><p>Cytoscape allows the user to add arbitrary node and edge information to Cytoscape as node and edge <span class="strong"><strong>attributes</strong></span>. Attributes could be, for example, annotation data on a gene or confidence values in a protein-protein interaction. These attributes can then be visualized in a user-defined way by setting up a mapping from data attributes to visual attributes (colors, shapes, etc.)  See the section on visual styles for a discussion of this. </p><p>Node and edge attribute files are simply formatted: A node attribute file begins with the name of the attribute on the first line, and on each following line, has the name of the node, followed by an equals sign, followed by the value of that attribute. Numbers and text strings are the most common attribute types. All values for a given attribute must have the same type. For example: </p><p/><pre class="screen">FunctionalCategory
YAL001C = metabolism
YAR002W = apoptosis
YBL007C = ribosome
</pre><p>An edge attribute file has much the same structure, except that the name of the edge is the source node name, followed by the interaction type in parentheses, followed by the target node name. Directionality counts, so switching the source and target will refer to a different (or perhaps non-existent) edge. The following is an example edge attributes file: </p><p/><pre class="screen">InteractionStrength
YAL001C (pp) YBR043W = 0.82
YMR022W (pd) YDL112C = 0.441
YDL112C (pd) YMR022W = 0.9013
</pre><p>Cytoscape treats edge attributes as directional, so note that the second and third edge attribute values refer to two different edges (source and target are reversed, though the nodes involved are the same). </p><p>Each attribute is stored in a separate file. Node and edge attribute files use the same format. Node attribute file names often use the suffix ".noa", while edge attribute file names use the suffix ".eda". Cytoscape recognizes these suffixes when browsing for attribute files. </p><p>Node and edge attributes may be loaded at the command line using the –n and –e options or via the <span class="underline">File → Import</span> menu. </p><p>When expression data is loaded using an expression matrix, it is automatically copied into the Node Attributes data structure unless explicitly specified not to. </p><p>Node and edge attributes are attached to nodes and edges, NOT to networks.  If two different networks have the same nodes, then those nodes will have the same attributes.  Even if a network is loaded after attributes have been loaded, if the nodes or edges found in the new network already exist, then any existing attributes will be applied to those nodes. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Detailed file format (Advanced users)</strong></span> Every attribute file has one header line that gives the name of the attribute, and optionally some additional meta-information about that attribute. The format is as follows: </p><p/><pre class="screen">attributeName (class=formal.class.of.value)
</pre><p>The first field is always the attribute name: it cannot contain spaces. If present, the class field defines the formal (package qualified) name of the class of the attribute values. For example, java.lang.String for Strings, java.lang.Double for floating point values, java.lang.Integer for integer values, etc. If the value is actually a list of values, the class should be the type of the objects in the list.  If no class is specified in the header line, Cytoscape will attempt to guess the type from the first value. If the first value contains numbers in a floating point format, Cytoscape will assume java.lang.Double; if the first value contains only numbers with no decimal point, Cytoscape will assume java.lang.Integer; otherwise Cytoscape will assume java.lang.String. Note that the first value can lead Cytoscape astray: for example, </p><p/><pre class="screen">floatingPointAttribute
firstName = 1
secondName = 2.5
</pre><p>In this case, the first value will make Cytoscape think the values should be integers, when in fact they should be floating point numbers. It's safest to explicitly specify the value type to prevent confusion. Every line past the first line identifies the name of an object and the String representation of the attribute value. The delimiter is always an equals sign; whitespace (spaces and/or tabs) before and after the equals sign is ignored. This means that your names and values can contain whitespace, but object names cannot contain an equals sign and no guarantees are made concerning leading or trailing whitespace. Usually the object names should be the same as the names in your graph file, unless name conversion is being used (see the section on name resolution in section). Edge names are all of the form: </p><p/><pre class="screen">sourceName (edgeType) targetName
</pre><p>Note that this format is different from the specification of interactions in the SIF file format. To be explicit: in a SIF file, an interaction looks like </p><p/><pre class="screen">sourceName edgeType targetName
</pre><p>To set an attribute for the edge defined by this interaction, the matching line in an attributes file should look like </p><p/><pre class="screen">sourceName (edgeType) targetName = value
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>(Yes, this is confusing; we're planning on fixing this in the next file format update for Cytoscape). To specify lists of values, use the following syntax: </li></ul></div><p/><pre class="screen">listAttributeName (class=java.lang.String)
firstObjectName = (firstValue::secondValue::thirdValue)
secondObjectName = (onlyOneValue)
</pre><p>This defines an attribute which is a list of Strings. The first object has three strings, and thus three elements in its list, while the second object has a list with only one member. In the case of a list every attribute value should be specified as a list, and every member of the list should be of the same class. Again, the class will be inferred if it is not specified in the header line. Lists are not supported by the visual mapper, so can’t be mapped to visual attributes. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Attribute Browser</strong></span> When Cytoscape is started, the Attribute Browser appears in the bottom Cytopanel. This browser can be hidden and restored using the F5 key or the <span class="underline">View → Show/Hide attribute browser</span> menu option. Like other Cytopanels, the browser can be undocked by pressing the little icon in the browser’s top right corner. </p><p>[attachment:attribute_browser_nodes.png] To swap between displaying node, edge, and network attributes use the tabs on the bottom of the panel: “Node Attribute Browser”, “Edge Attribute Browser”, and "Network Attribute Browser". The attribute browser displays attributes belonging to selected nodes and/or edges and the currently selected network. To populate the browser with rows (as pictured above), simply select nodes and/or edges in a loaded network. By default, only the “ID” of nodes and edges is shown. To display more than just the ID, click the “Select Attributes” [attachment:attributes_select_icon.png] button and choose the attributes that are to be displayed. Each attribute chosen will result in one column in the attribute browser (in the screenshot above there are 5 columns total including the ID). Most attribute values can be edited by double-clicking an attribute cell; list values cannot be edited, and neither can the ID. Attribute rows in the browser can be sorted alphabetically by specific attribute by clicking on a column heading. A new attribute can be created using the “Create New Attribute” [attachment:attributes_new_icon.png] button. Attributes created using the attribute browser must be one of four types – integer, string, real number (floating point), or boolean. Attributes can be deleted using the "Delete Attributes..." [attachment:attributes_delete_icon.png] button. NOTE: Deleting attributes removes them from Cytoscape, not just the attribute browser! To remove attributes only from the browser simply unselect the attribute using the "Select Attributes" [attachment:attributes_select_icon.png] button. The right-click menu on the Attribute Browser has several functions. This menu is useful for exporting attribute information to spreadsheet applications. For example, choose “Select All” and then “Copy” from the right-click and then paste into a spreadsheet application.  Each attribute browser panel has a button for importing new attributes: [attachment:attributes_import_icon.png] . </p><p>The Node Attribute Browser panel has additional buttons for loading Gene Expression attribute matrices ( [attachment:attributes_gene_expr_icon.png] ) and for selecting Gene Ontology (GO) terms ( [attachment:attributes_go_icon.png] ) as node attributes.  The Ontology selection button is only available if an Ontology Server has been imported.

Some of the layout algorithms provided with Cytoscape 2.3 are: </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Cytoscape Spring-embedded Layout </strong></span> </p><p>Spring-embedded layout is based on a “force-directed” paradigm. Network nodes are treated like physical objects that repel each other, such as electrons. The connections between nodes are treated like metal springs attached to the pair of nodes. These springs repel or attract their end points according to a force function. The layout algorithm sets the positions of the nodes in a way that minimizes the sum of forces in the network. This algorithm is available from the <span class="underline">Layout → Cytoscape Layouts → Spring Embedded</span> menu item. A sample screen shot is provided below: </p><p>[attachment:image051.png] <span class="strong"><strong>yFiles Circular Layout </strong></span> </p><p>This algorithm produces layouts that emphasize group and tree structures within a network.

The palette contains a set of shapes (for nodes) and arrows (for edges). The shapes on the palette are defined by the current Visual Style, with Node Shape and Node Color mapping into the shape and color of a node, and Edge Target Arrow mapping into the target arrow of an edge. An example of an editor, with the palette contained in <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/CytoPanel" target="_top">CytoPanel</a> 1, is shown below. </p><p>[attachment:image096.gif] To edit an existing network, just select the Editor tab in <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/CytoPanel" target="_top">CytoPanel</a> 1.

Control-clicking at a position on the canvas creates a node at that position. The NODE_TYPE attribute of the node will be the same as the NODE_TYPE of the node most recently added, defaulting to "<a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DefaultNode" target="_top">DefaultNode</a>" type. In this manner, you can use control-clicking as a kind of "stamp" to add multiple nodes of the same type to the network. Control-clicking on a node on the canvas starts an edge with source at that node. Move the cursor and a rubber-banded line follows the cursor. As the cursor passes over another node, that node is highlighted and the rubber-banded line will snap to a connection point on that second node. Control-click the mouse again and the connection is established. The EDGE_TYPE attribute of the edge will be the same as the EDGE_TYPE of the edge most recently added, defaulting to "<a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DefaultEdge" target="_top">DefaultEdge</a>" type. You can abort the drawing of the edge by control-clicking on an empty spot on the palette. </p><p>You can delete nodes and edges by selecting a number of nodes and edges, then selecting the <span class="underline">Edit → Delete Selected Nodes and Edges</span> menu item.

The goal of the rendering engine is to be able to display large networks (&gt;10,000 nodes) yet retain interactive speed.  To accomplish this goal a technique involving <span class="emphasis"><em>level of detail</em></span> is being used.  Based on the count of objects (nodes and edges) being rendered, an appropriate <span class="emphasis"><em>level of detail</em></span> is chosen.  For example, by default, node labels (if present) are only rendered when less than 100 nodes are visible because drawing text is a relatively expensive operation.  This can create some unusual behavior. If the screen currently contains 98 nodes, node labels will be displayed.  If you pan the screen, such that now 101 nodes are displayed, the node labels will disappear.  As another example, if the sum of rendered edges and rendered nodes is greater than or equal to a default value of 2000, a very coarse level of detail is chosen, where edges are always straight lines, nodes are always rectangles, and no antialiasing is done.  The default values used to determine these thresholds can be changed by setting properties in the <span class="underline">Edit → Preferences</span> menu.   <span class="strong"><strong>Beware!</strong></span>  The greater these thresholds become, the slower performance will become.  If you work with small networks (a few hundred nodes), this shouldn't be a problem, but for large networks it will produce noticeable slowing.

An ontology consists of a set of controlled vocabulary terms that annotate the genes for a given organism and a synonym table for gene names. For example, using the Gene Ontology, the Saccharomyces Cerevisiae <span class="strong"><strong>GAL4</strong></span> gene’s biological process is described as “regulation of transcription”, to which GO has assigned the number 45449 (a GO ID). You can see below that “regulation of transcription” is a subcategory of “transcription”, which is a subcategory of “nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism”, etc. </p><p/><pre class="screen">GO 8150 biological_process

</pre><p>Cytoscape can use this ‘hierarchical’ ontology to annotate recognized genes if the user chooses a level of the hierarchy to use for a given set of annotations.

Select <span class="emphasis"><em>Gene Ontology</em></span> to use the new formats (obo and gene_association files). If you want to use the old file formats, select <span class="emphasis"><em>Cytoscape <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/BioDataServer" target="_top">BioDataServer</a></em></span>. A description of how the old formats can be created and used can be found in Appendix B. </p><p><span class="underline">Step 2.</span> Select OBO File </p><p>[attachment:ontology_wizard_obo.png] If you choose <span class="emphasis"><em>Gene Ontology </em></span>in the first step, this panel appears to help you first select an OBO (ontology) file. The wizard displays the header information of the OBO file loaded.  Once an OBO file is loaded, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Next</em></span> button becomes enabled.  Click the <span class="emphasis"><em>Next</em></span> button to proceed. </p><p><span class="underline">Step 3.</span> Select Gene Association File </p><p>[attachment:ontology_wizard_goa.png] </p><p>You can add a gene_association file to the list by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Add</em></span> button. Once you select a file, the file name will be shown in the list in the left. If you click on the file name, the header information will be displayed in the center window. You can select multiple gene_association files. </p><p>The "Transfer GO Species Name to Nodes" can be used to apply the species name (taxon) found in the selected Gene Association file to the nodes of the currently selected network.  This may be an important feature if the nodes of your network do not have a species attribute set.  You can can see the current network's nodes and species attribute for the nodes in the left hand window.  You can see the GO symbols, terms, aspects, synonyms, and taxons (species), in the bottom window.  For nodes in your network to map to GO terms, either a symbol or synonym of a term must match the node ID. </p><p><span class="underline">Step 4.</span> </p><p>Once you have finished specifying the options, click on finish. The OBO file and gene_association files specified in this panel will be automatically loaded. This will then open up the Ontology Mapper dialog. </p><p>[attachment:ontology_mapper.png] </p><p>The Ontology Mapper is used to reduce the number of node attributes created from the gene ontology.  Selecting a term in the left hand column and clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></span> button will select that term to create an attribute for.  You can unselect a term using the <span class="strong"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong></span> button.  The <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Apply All</strong></span></em></span> button will select all terms for attribute creation. In most cases, <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Apply All</strong></span></em></span> should be used to import all GO Terms for the network.  Otherwise, only subset of GO Terms in the tree is imported.  Once the desired terms have been selected, click the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button.  This will create node attributes for all selected GO terms.  If you select some GO Terms in the right-side  window, nodes with the GO Terms will be shown in the Node <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/AttributeBrowser" target="_top">AttributeBrowser</a>.  By right-clicking on a GO Term in the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>GO Data as Attributes</strong></span></em></span> window, you can search the GO Term in AmiGO (this function requires internet connection and a web browser).  The GO terms will now be visibile in the Node Attribute Browser by clicking on the Select button ( [attachment:attributes_select_icon.png] ). </p><p>If you would like to choose deifferent GO terms from the same gene association file, you do not need to re-import the files. Instead, you can click the GO button ( [attachment:attributes_go_icon.png] ) in the Attribute Browser panel or on the <span class="underline">File → Import → Ontology → Ontology Mapper</span> menu and the Ontology Mapper dialog will open. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Note 1:</strong></span> The <span class="underline">OBO file and gene_association files MUST be in the same directory</span>, and you must have write permission for the directory. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Note 2:</strong></span> Please make sure that your network file uses exact same ID’s used in the gene association file (Symbol or Synonym column). Otherwise, the annotations will not appear in the Annotation Panel. </p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Filters"/>Filters</h2></div></div></div><p>The Cytoscape Filter plugin, which is packaged with the official Cytoscape 2.2 release and is active by default, allows for a wide variety of filtering on node and edge attributes loaded onto Cytoscape networks. For example, you can easily select all the nodes whose name contains a specific pattern that you define. Several types of filters are available. Basic filters allow the selection of multiple nodes or edges according to attribute data: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>String </strong></span>filters allow selection of nodes or edges with attributes matching specified patterns. These patterns may include the wildcards * and ?. </p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Numerical</strong></span> filters allow selection of nodes or edges according to numerical attributes and the mathematical operators &gt;, =, and &lt;. </p></li></ul></div><p>Compound filters allow selection based on the application of pre-existing filters: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Topology</strong></span> filters allow selection of nodes with neighbors that match some pre-existing filter. </p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Boolean</strong></span> filters allow the combination of multiple filters using the AND, OR and XOR operators. Example filters are shipped with the plugin to get started. </p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Using the Plugin</strong></span> </p><p>If the Filter plugin is loaded, then you should see a filter icon on the toolbar. </p><p>[attachment:image110.gif] If you press the filter icon, you will see a filters dialog which looks initially like the following: </p><p>[attachment:image111.png] If the first filter is selected, then the dialog looks as shown: </p><p>[attachment:image124.png] As for the colors: </p><p>The Purple Box: An existing or newly created filter can be edited in this area. Each filter type has its own user interface for editing. </p><p>The Orange Box: All available filters are shown in this list. Initially, this list will contain sample filters, but as you create more, they will be added here. </p><p>The Cyan Box: Pressing “Create new filter” adds a filter to the “Available Filters” box, and “Remove selected filter” deletes the currently selected filter. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Creating Filters</strong></span> </p><p>The “Create new filter” button brings up the Filter creation dialog box, shown below. </p><p>[attachment:image127.png] The important thing to realize when creating a filter is that the filter does not <span class="strong"><strong>do</strong></span> anything by itself. Once created, the filter must be run. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>String Filter:</strong></span> </p><p>[attachment:image129.png] The String Filter allows you to filter nodes or edges by a given string node or edge attribute. Attributes that are loaded on the network are available for filtering against. Search terms are entered in the text box at the bottom. For example to match any Node whose canonicalName starts with “YDL” you would select “Node”, “canonicalName” and type “YDL*”. The * is important as it matches any number of characters after YDL. If you want to be more specific and only select nodes whose canonicalName starts with YDL00 followed by any other two characters, you would type “YDL00??”. The “?” denotes any single character, while the “*” represents zero or more characters. Full regular expression searching is supported, although is not covered here. Once the filter is defined, it will be assigned a default descriptive name. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Numerical Filter:</strong></span> </p><p>[attachment:image131.png] The Numerical Filter also allows you to filter nodes or edges, and presents you with a list of available attributes. This filter matches greater-than, less-than, or equal-to a number you type in the search box. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Node Topology Filter:</strong></span> </p><p>[attachment:image133.png] The node topology filter allows you to select nodes with at least <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> neighbors of distance <span class="emphasis"><em>m </em></span>or less that pass some other selected filter. For instance, to select all the nodes adjacent to a node with the canonical name matching ‘YD*’, you would “select nodes with 1 neighbors”, “within distance 1”, “that pass the filter Node: canonicalName ~ YD*”. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Boolean Filter:</strong></span> </p><p>[attachment:image135.png] The Boolean Meta-Filter allows you to define a new filter that is a logical combination of existing filters. Available filters are displayed. By selecting one or more filters, you can then choose whether Nodes or Edges pass “ALL” (AND), “AT LEAST ONE” (OR), or “ONLY ONE” (XOR) of the selected filters. Once created Boolean filters can then themselves be combined using the Boolean filter to create arbitrarily complex logical combinations of filters. Note that unlike the String and Numerical Filters, Boolean Filters will need to be assigned a name manually. </p><p>Once created, filters are saved for future sessions, as long as you exit Cytoscape normally via the exit command in the File menu (i.e. not via ctrl-c on Linux). </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Running filters</strong></span> Any available filter can be run by pressing the ‘Apply selected filter’ button. When a filter is applied and multiple nodes or edges are selected, all of the normal selection-related operations may be performed, such as Delete Selected Node/Edges, Copy To New Network, and Invert Selection. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Linkout"/>Linkout</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/LinkOut" target="_top">LinkOut</a> plugin provides a mechanism to link nodes to external web resources within Cytoscape. Right-clicking on a node item in Cytoscape view opens a popup menu with a list of web links. </p><p>The external links are specified in the <code class="code">linkout.props</code> file, which includes a number of default links such as Entrez, SGD, iHOP, Google, as well as a number of species-specific links. In addition to the default links, users can customize the <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/LinkOut" target="_top">LinkOut</a> menu by adding (or removing) links without the need to restart Cytoscape or reload the network. </p><p>External links are listed as <span class="emphasis"><em>‘key’-‘value’</em></span> pairs in the <code class="code">linkout.props</code> file where <span class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span> specifies the name of the link and <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> is the search URL. The LinkOut menus are organized in a hierarchical structure that is specified in the key. All key terms start with the keyword <code class="code">linkouturl</code>. </p><p>For example, the following entry: <code class="code">linkouturl.yeast.SGD=http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.pl?locus\=%ID%</code> </p><p>places the SGD link under the yeast submenu. This link will appear in Cytoscape as: </p><p>[attachment:Figure1_linkout.png] </p><p>In a similar fashion one can added new submenus. </p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong><code class="code">%ID%</code></strong></span> string in the URL is a place-holder for the node label. When the popup menu is generated this marker is substituted with the node label. In the above example the generated SGD link for YIM protein is: <code class="code">http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.pl?locus\=YIM1</code> </p><p>Currently there is no mechanism to check whether the constructed URL query is correct and if the node label is meaningful. Similarly there is no ID mapping between various identifiers. For example, a link to NCBI Entrez from a network that uses ensembl gene identifiers as node label will produce a link to Entrez using ensembl ID, which results in an incorrect link. It is the users responsibility to ensure that the node label that is used as the search term in the URL link will result in a meaningful link. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Adding or Removing links</strong></span> The default links are defined in a <code class="code">linkout.props</code> file contained in the linkout.jar.  These links are normal java properties and can be editited while running in the <span class="underline">Edit → Preferences</span> menu.  New links can be defined this way as well.  New links can be defined at startup in a separate file and loaded from the command line, either by specifying a file containing the links <code class="code">cytoscape.sh -P new_linout.props</code> or as individual properties <code class="code">cytoscape.sh -P linkouturl.yeast.SGD=http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.pl?locus\=%ID%</code>. Any links defined on the command line will supersede the default links. </p><p>To remove a link from the menu simply delete the property from the <span class="underline">Edit → Preferences</span>  menu. </p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><a id="acknowledgements"/></li></ul></div><p/><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Acknowledgements"/>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div></div><p>Cytoscape is built with a number of open source 3rd party Java libraries.

</pre><p>The first sample contains molecular function annotation for proteins, and each protein is identified by its IPI number. IPI is the International Protein Index, which maintains cross references to the main databases for human, mouse and rat proteomes.  The second sample contains biological process annotation, and each protein is identified by its NP (<a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RefSeq" target="_top">RefSeq</a>) number.  These two naming systems, IPI and <a href="http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RefSeq" target="_top">RefSeq</a>, are two of many that you can use for canonical names when you run Cytoscape. For budding yeast, it is much easier: the yeast community always uses standard ORF names, and so Cytoscape uses these as canonical names.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] </li></ul></div><p>Preamble </p><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. </p><p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. </p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. </p><p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. </p><p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </p><p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. </p><p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. </p><p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. </p><p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. </p><p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with  the library.    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License  because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary  General Public License.  It also provides other free software  developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.   These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public  License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides  advantages in certain special circumstances.    For example, on rare  occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible  use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To  achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.   A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely  used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the  free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public  License.    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body  of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.     Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'  freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the  Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a  modified version of the Library.    The precise terms and conditions for  copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the  difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses  the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas  the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.      </p><p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    TERMS AND  CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     </p><p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General  Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed  as "you".    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or  data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright  law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into  another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation  in the term "modification".)    "Source code" for a work means the preferred  form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete  source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control  compilation and installation of the library.    Activities other than copying,  distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are  outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not  restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the  Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what  the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.       </p><p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. </p><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </p><p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </p><p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. </p><p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. </p><p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </p><p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) </p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. </p><p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices. </p><p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. </p><p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. </p><p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. </p><p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. </p><p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </p><p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. </p><p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. </p><p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) </p><p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. </p><p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. </p><p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things: </p><p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) </p><p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. </p><p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. </p><p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. </p><p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. </p><p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </p><p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. </p><p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: </p><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. </p><p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. </p><p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. </p><p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. </p><p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. </p><p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </p><p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. </p><p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. </p><p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. </p><p>NO WARRANTY </p><p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </p><p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p><p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS </p></div></div></body></html>
