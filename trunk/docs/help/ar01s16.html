The following screenshot shows the file <code class="code">galFiltered.sif</code> loaded into Cytoscape.  In CytoPanel 1 (at the left-hand side of the screen), the Network Manager, Network Overview, and Cytoscape Editor have been loaded.  In addition, in CytoPanel 2, the Node Attribute Browser has been loaded. </p><p>

   </p><p>The user can then choose to resize, hide or float the left CytoPanel. For example, in the screenshot below, the user has chosen to float CytoPanel 1: </p><p>

By default, CytoPanels 1 and 2 will appear. CytoPanel 3 may appear, depending on the mix of Cytoscape plugins that you currently have installed. </p><p>CytoPanels 1 and 2 can be shown or hidden using the View &#8594; Show/Hide functions. </p><p>

   </p><p>In addition, CytoPanels can be floated or docked by selecting the icon at the top right corner of each CytoPanel. The icon and tooltip will change based on the CytoPanel state. If the CytoPanel is docked, clicking on the icon will float the CytoPanel, as indicated by the &#8220;Float Window&#8221; tooltip. Alternatively, if the CytoPanel is floating, clicking on the icon will dock the CytoPanel, as indicated by the &#8220;Dock Window&#8221; tooltip. </p><p>
