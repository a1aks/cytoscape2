Extends the minimalistic topological definition of a graph to include
information about position of a graph's nodes in some space.  Right now,
&quot;some space&quot; means &quot;2D real space&quot;, and I'm not sure
how I'd structure additional code/packages if I were to support, say,
layouts in 3D space.
