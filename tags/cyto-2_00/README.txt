I.  Doing a Clean Checkout
==========================

If this is the first time reading this, make sure that you have done a clean checkout.  To
do this, create a backup of your local installation of cytoscape.  Then, set your CVSROOT environment
variable to point to:  /common/cvsdir5.

Then, do a clean check-out:

cvs checkout -P cytoscape

II.  New Directory Structure
============================

Cytoscape now contains the following directory structure:

cytoscape
   +
   +---bin/       Contains all OS specific scripts, e.g. shell scripts and batch files.
   +
   +---build/     This directoy is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain all generated class files.
   +
   +---config/    Contains all configuration files, e.g. cytoscape.props.
   +
   +---cytodocs/  Contains all technical documentation.
   +
   +---dist/      This directory is automatically generated by Ant.  After compilation,
   +              this directory will contain cytoscape.jar.
   +
   +---images/    Contains image files
   +
   +---legacy/    Contains legacy files which will no longer be supported.
   +
   +---lib/       Contains all JAR files.
   +
   +---src/       Contains all source .java files.
   +
   +---testData/  Contains all test data
   +
   +---tools/     Contains misc. tools for cytoscape distribution.
   +
   +---user_docs/ Contains all user documentation and manuals.

III. New Build Process
======================

To build cytoscape:

1.  Download and install Jakarta Ant.  Download from:  http://ant.apache.org/.  Installation instructions
are available at:  http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html.

2.  To compile cytoscape, type:

ant

3.  To run cytoscape, type:

ant run

If cytoscape appears, everything is set up correctly!

For questions, email Ethan Cerami:  cerami@cbio.mskcc.org.

IV.  Building Cytoscape Plug-Ins
================================

Cytoscape plug-ins are expected to have their own ant build.xml files that can be used to
build JAR files for each plugin.  Also, cytoscape/plugins contains stable plugins that are
made available with the official Cytoscape release.

For old Cytoscape 1.1 plug-ins, you might have to follow these directions:

The csplugins directory uses the same build process as before.  To compile csplugins,
you therefore need to do the following:

define your java CLASSPATH to include at least

    <full-path-to-current-directory>/build/classes
    <full-path-to-immediate-parent-directory>

then, cd to csplugins, and type:

  make

V.  Doing a Full Cytoscape Release
===================================

This section contains notes / tasks for doing a full Cytoscape release.  Doing a full release
of Cytoscape is rather involved.  Some of the tasks are automated and some are manual.

	A.  Core Release Tasks
	----------------------------
	Modify the Cytoscape Version Number in build.xml
		The ant build.xml file contains a property that looks like this:
		
		<property name="version" value="2.0ALPHA4"/>
		
		The value of this property is very important as it is used to create
		the final release files.  For example, the final release file for 2.0ALPHA4 will
		be cytoscape-v2.0ALPHA4.tar.gz.
		
		Update this value to the current version number.
	
	Tag the Complete Release
		The tag convention we have adopted looks like this:  "cyto-2_0-alpha4".
		Please follow this convention.
		
		To tag a release:
		
		cvs tag cyto-2_0-alpha4
		
	Create the final release files
		To do so, run:  ant zip_release
		
		The final release files are all placed in cytoscape/zip_release.
		
		This includes three files:  
			a.  a binary .tar.gz file (for Linux / Mac OS X)
			b.  a binary .zip file (for Windows)
			c.  a source .tar.gz file
	
	Deploy the new release files.
		Currently, we are hosting the release files on cbio.mskcc.org only.
		Release files are located in /var/www/cytoscape/release.
		
		Obviously, only MSKCC people can perform this task.
		
	B.  Creating the Mac OS X Release
	---------------------------------------
	We now have a Mac OS X specific release.
	
	To create the Mac OS X Specific Release
		1.  run ant task:  ant mac
		2.  rename cytoscape/release to cytoscape/Cytoscape2.0
		3.  create a Mac OS X Disk Image File (.dmg)
			--  this is done manually via the Mac Disk Utility program.
			--  in Disk Utility, click "New Image", specify the name "cytoscape", and select 20 MB.
			--  once the image is created on your desktop, drag cytoscape/Cytoscape2.0 to 
				the image.
		3.  modify the default image for the Cytoscape 2.0 folder to use the Cytoscape Icon
			--  to do so, to go to Cytoscape2.0/cytoscape.app, click "Get Info", 
				and expand the tab labeled, "Preview".
			--  select the icon, and hit Apple-C (Copy)
			--  go to Cytoscape 2.0, click "Get Info", and expand the tab labeled, "Preview".
			--  select the icon, and hit Apple-V (Paste)
		4.  create cytoscape.dmg.zip
			--  to do so, right click on cytoscape.dmg, and select "Create Archive"
		
	Deploy the new release file
		As in the section above, we are currently hosting the release files on cbio.mskcc.org only.
		Release files are located in /var/www/cytoscape/release.

	C.  Creating the InstallAnywhere Release
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	ISB currently handles this step, and hosts the InstallAnywhere release.  Rowan
	may want to add details to this section.
	
	D.  Update Cytocape.org Web Site
	-------------------------------------------------	

	Make sure Cytoscape 2.0 Manual (PDF) is Up-to-Date
		We currently keep a copy of Cytoscape2_0Manual.pdf checked into
		two places:  cytscape/user_docs and cyto_web/manual.  cytoscape/user_docs is 
		the definitive one, and cyto_web/manual is the copy.
		
		Before doing a full release, make sure to copy the latest manual from
		cytoscape/user_docs to cyto_web/manual, and check in the latest version.
		
	Update cyto_web/config.php
	
		This file contains global configurations for cytoscape.org
		The most important thing to check is:
		
		#################################################
		#  Specifies the Current Cytoscape Release Version
		#  Update this version number after each release.
		#################################################
		$version = "v2.0ALPHA4";

		Make sure that $version matches the version now specified in build.xml.
		
	Deploy Everything to cytoscape.org
		To do so, update cyto_web/cyto.properties with a valid user/password.
		If you don't have one, email Trey or Ethan.
		
		Then, type:  ant deploy.
	
	Copy over the latest Javadocs.
		Latest Javadocs are currently hosted on cbio.mkscc.org, and are not part
		of cytoscape.org.  That's mainly because cytoscape.org FTP connection is so slow.
		
		First, run:  ant doc.
		
		Then, tar/gzip everything in the API directory.
		
		scp the gzip file to /var/www/cytoscape/javadoc and unpack.
