Members of the Cytoscape Consortium should include an SVG version 
of their logo in this directory.  We need a vector version of
the logo because the logos will be used in different places like
splash screens, websites, credit screens, etc., so we need to be
able to scale the image appropriated.  Since many of these graphics
are generated dynamically, SVG is the easiest for us to use.  
Programs like Adobe Illustrator can easily save PDF, PS, or EPS
graphics as SVG.  Please do NOT include SVG images with embedded 
bitmap (jpg, png, gif) graphics as these images do NOT scale well.  

We promise not to modify the graphics (aside from scale) or otherwise
compromise the integrity of the logo.
